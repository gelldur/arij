ariJ - **a**nother **r**eally **i**nteresting **J**ira 
====
...client for Android. Yes, I came up with this acronym right now.

It's my pet project, I want to learn new stuff, test different approaches using different libraries, so don't expect
well formed codebase, at least at the beginning.

Current state
===
* multiple accounts support
* 4 predefined filters to display issues
* comments view/add

* assigning tasks to logged in user

In progress
===

* plugin for jira to support Google Cloud Messaging to send push notifications
* tbc

How to build
===
I usually care about as little external(non easy-maven-downloadable) dependencies as possible, so it shouldn't be a problem.
Just make sure that your ANDROID_HOME environment variable is set properly.

```bash
mvn validate install
``` 
and magic should happen ;)
If not - [create an issue](http://github.com/tmszdmsk/arij/issues/new) or write an [e-mail](mailto:tomasz.adamski@gmail.com)
