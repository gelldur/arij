**a**nother **r**eally **i**nteresting **J**ira client - yes, I came up with this acronym right now.

It's my pet project, I want to learn new stuff, test different approaches using different libraries, so don't expect
well formed codebase, at least at the beginning.

Current state:
===
* multiple accounts support
* presents list of first N issues assigned to logged in user
* screen with basic informations about issue
* allows to start work on issue with timer and log that work later

Features planned:
===
* assigning tasks to logged in user
* transition between issue states (starting work, stopping it, resolving)
* comments view/add
* worklog view/add
* multiple filters
* tbd
